# Electronic Filing / Case Management System

The [U.S. Tax Court](https://ustaxcourt.gov/) currently uses a non-web-based legacy case management system operated through several, disparate desktop applications installed on individual workstations. Flexion was awarded a competitive bid in October 2018 to develop and deploy a new web-based electronic filing and case management system that would provide a single integrated point to handle all communication, documentation, and task workflows associated with moving a case through the Court from inception to completion. The new system would allow the public to file new cases, track them, and submit additional information about their cases through a secure online portal, instead of the current mail-based, paper petitioning process. It also provides the Court with the means to transfer most of their paper-based processes and workflows into easier, more efficient online ones.

Work is not yet in production, so `master` does not deploy. For additional background, see [the RFQ to procure agile software development services](https://github.com/ustaxcourt/case-management-rfq).

The fork of this project in which the bulk of development is occurring is [Flexion’s fork](https://github.com/flexion/ef-cms), but all changes are pulled into the U.S. Tax Court’s repository every two weeks.

Artifacts for ongoing development such as designs, research data, user workflows etc. are located in the [wiki](https://github.com/flexion/ef-cms/wiki). See also [documentation about how we work](https://github.com/ustaxcourt/ef-cms/blob/staging/docs/how-we-work.md): our principles, product team, technical strategy, meetings cadence, tools, etc.

## Technical overview

This is a React-based JavaScript application. It’s housed in a [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) that contains the front end (`web-client/`) and the back end (`web-api/`), with a third project housing resources that are shared between the front and back ends (`shared/`). It’s architected for Amazon Web Services, with a strong reliance on [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), scripted with Terraform. The project is heavily containerized, using Docker, and can be run locally, despite the serverless architecture. All CI/CD processes are found in `management/`. Deployment is done via CircleCI.

## Documentation

For documentation about the CI/CD setup, API, style guide, UX, code review, etc., see [docs/README.md](docs/README.md).

## Backlog

The backlog is stored [in GitHub Issues in Flexion’s repository](https://github.com/flexion/ef-cms/issues), _not_ on this repository. Although they can be viewed like any other GitHub issues, they are managed on a scrum board that requires the [ZenHub browser plugin](https://www.zenhub.com/) to see.

## Testing everything

To exercise the CI/CD pipeline locally, run the following:

`./test-all.sh`

This will run the linter, Shellcheck, audit, build, test, Cypress, Cerebral tests, Pa11y, etc. over all the components.

## Running / verifying the project via Docker

Once [you have Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/install/), the following command will spin up a Docker container with the UI, API, local S3, local Dynamo, etc. all running inside it:

`./docker-run.sh`

- You can access the UI at http://localhost:1234
- You can access the public UI at http://localhost:5678
- You can access the API at http://localhost:3000
- You can access the DynamoDB shell at http://localhost:8000/shell
- You can access the DynamoDB admin UI at http://localhost:8001
- You can access S3 local at http://localhost:9000
- You can access the style guide at http://localhost:1234/style-guide

Within Docker, you should allocate 4 CPUs, 16 GB of RAM, and 4 GB of swap. With fewer resources, the software is likely to fail to run with errors that don’t make it obvious what the problem is.

## Running this project locally without Docker

The EF-CMS is comprised of two components: the API and the UI. Both must be run in order to function.

### Prerequisites

- Node v12.13.1
- npm v6.12.1
- ClamAV v0.101.2 (see Setup below)
-  Java 11

### Setup

- Install the JDK from https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk13-downloads.html
For ClamAV, macOS users can do the following:
- `brew install clamav`
- `cp /usr/local/etc/clamav/freshclam.conf.sample /usr/local/etc/clamav/freshclam.conf`
- `sed -ie 's/^Example/#Example/g' /usr/local/etc/clamav/freshclam.conf` (comments out `Example` in the `freshclam.conf` file)

Both the front-end (`/web-client`) and API (`/web-api`) share code that exists in `/shared`. Before you can run either, you need to run `npm install` inside the top-level directory.

- `npm i`

#### Terminal A

- `npm run start:api`

##### Other Start Commands

- Run `cd web-client && npm run start:client:no-scanner` to start the UI without Dynamsoft (or if you don't have a scanner)
- Run `npm run start:public` to start the UI for the public access portion of the site

#### Terminal B

- `npm run start:client`

## Login and test users

There are two login mechanisms available — the legacy mock login system, and a new one that emulates AWS Cognito.

### Mock login

You can log in using the following accounts.

#### External Users

```

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) for additional information.

## Testing / Coverage Tips

- Run all tests with `npm run test`
- The web client, api, and shared code can be tested with `npm run test:client`, `npm run test:api`, and `npm run test:shared`, respectively.
- TIP: When working through a single test, you can run a single test with `jest /path/to/test/file.js` (you may need to `npm -i -g jest`). Additionally, you can use `--watch` and `--coverage` flags to to continually run the specified test on save and provide a coverage report. For example: `jest /path/to/test/file.js --watch --coverage`

Example coverage output:
```
----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|-------------------|
File      |  % Stmts | % Branch |  % Funcs |  % Lines | Uncovered Line #s |
----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|-------------------|
All files |        0 |        0 |        0 |        0 |                   |
----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|-------------------|
```
- Stmts: % of statements executed in the code
- Branch: % of control structures (for example, if statements) executed in the code
- Funcs: % of functions executed in the code
- Uncovered Line #s: lines not covered by tests
