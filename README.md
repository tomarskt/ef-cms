# Electronic Filing / Case Management System

An as-yet-unnamed project by the [U.S. Tax Court](https://ustaxcourt.gov/), creating an open-source EF-CMS, which began in October 2018. Work is not yet in production, so `master` does not deploy. For background, see [the RFQ to procure agile software development services](https://github.com/ustaxcourt/case-management-rfq).

The fork of this project in which the bulk of development is occurring is [Flexion’s fork](https://github.com/flexion/ef-cms).

Artifacts for ongoing development such as designs, research data, user workflows etc. are located in the [wiki](https://github.com/flexion/ef-cms/wiki).

## Technical overview

This is a React-based JavaScript application. It’s housed in a [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) that contains the front end (`web-client/`) and the back end (`web-api/`), with a third project housing resources that are shared between the front and back ends (`shared/`). It’s architected for Amazon Web Services, with a strong reliance on [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), scripted with Terraform. The project is heavily containerized, using Docker, and can be run locally, despite the serverless architecture. All CI/CD processes are found in `management/`. Deployment is done via CircleCI.

## Documentation

For documentation about the CI/CD setup, API, style guide, UX, code review, etc., see [docs/README.md](docs/README.md).

## Backlog

The backlog is stored [in GitHub Issues in Flexion’s repository](https://github.com/flexion/ef-cms/issues), _not_ on this repository. Although they can be viewed like any other GitHub issues, they are managed on a scrum board that requires the [ZenHub browser plugin](https://www.zenhub.com/) to see.

## Testing everything

To exercise the CI/CD pipeline locally, run the following:

`./test-all.sh`

This will run the linter, Shellcheck, audit, build, test, Cypress, Cerebral tests, Pa11y, etc. over all the components.

## Running / verifying the project via Docker

Once [you have Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/install/), the following command will spin up a Docker container with the UI, API, local S3, local Dynamo, etc. all running inside it:

`./docker-run.sh`

- You can access the UI at http://localhost:1234
- You can access the public UI at http://localhost:5678
- You can access the API at http://localhost:3000
- You can access the DynamoDB shell at http://localhost:8000/shell
- You can access the DynamoDB admin UI at http://localhost:8001
- You can access S3 local at http://localhost:9000
- You can access the style guide at http://localhost:1234/style-guide

Within Docker, you should allocate 4 CPUs, 16 GB of RAM, and 4 GB of swap. With fewer resources, the software is likely to fail to run with errors that don’t make it obvious what the problem is.

### ECR
ECR is Amazon’s docker container registry that holds images for `ef-cms` builds on CircleCI. Currently, images can be managed in the AWS ECR console under the `ef-cms-us-east-1`. If you need to update the Docker image, you can do so (with appropriate permissions) by running `./docker-to-ecr.sh`. This command will build an image per the `Dockerfile-CI` config, tag it as `latest` and push it to the repo in ECR.

## Running this project locally without Docker

The EF-CMS is comprised of two components: the API and the UI. Both must be run in order to function.

### Prerequisites

- Node v12.13.1
- npm v6.12.1
- ClamAV v0.101.2 (see Setup below)

### Setup

For ClamAV, macOS users can do the following:
- `brew install clamav`
- `cp /usr/local/etc/clamav/freshclam.conf.sample /usr/local/etc/clamav/freshclam.conf`
- `sed -ie 's/^Example/#Example/g' /usr/local/etc/clamav/freshclam.conf` (comments out `Example` in the `freshclam.conf` file)

Both the front-end (`/web-client`) and API (`/web-api`) share code that exists in `/shared`. Before you can run either, you need to run `npm install` inside the top-level directory.

- `npm i`

#### Terminal A

- `npm run start:api`

##### Other Start Commands

- Run `cd web-client && npm start:client:no-scanner` to start the UI without Dynamsoft (or if you don't have a scanner)
- Run `npm run start:public` to start the UI for the public access portion of the site

#### Terminal B

- `npm run start:client`

## Login and test users

There are two login mechanisms available — the legacy mock login system, and a new one that emulates AWS Cognito.

### Mock login

You can log in using the following accounts.

#### External Users

```
petitioner
practitioner
practitioner1 - practitioner4
respondent
respondent1 - respondent4
```

#### Internal Users
```
adc
admissionsclerk

petitionsclerk1
trialclerk
judgeArmen
armensChambers
judgeAshford
ashfordsChambers
judgeBuch
buchsChambers
judgeCarluzzo
carluzzosChambers
judgeCohen
cohensChambers
```

No password is required.

### AWS Cognito

To use Cognito, start the web client with `npm run dev:cognito` (instead of `npm start`) You can then log in with the following accounts.

#### External Users
```
petitioner1@example.com – petitioner5@example.com
practitioner1@example.com – practitioner10@example.com
respondent1@example.com – respondent10@example.com
```

#### Internal Users
```
adc1@example.com – adc5@example.com
admissionsclerk1@example.com – admissionsclerk5@example.com
clerkofcourt1@example.com – clerkofcourt5@example.com
docketclerk1@example.com – docketclerk5@example.com

## Editor configuration

### Atom.io

Install the following for best results:

- https://atom.io/packages/language-javascript-jsx
- https://atom.io/packages/language-groovy
- https://atom.io/packages/linter-eslint
- https://atom.io/packages/prettier-atom (enable ESLint and StyleLint integrations in settings)

## Forked dependencies

The software has several dependencies that required minor modifications to suit our needs. In some cases, those are urgent security-related modifications that we needed to make immediately, rather than waiting for those dependencies to be patched. In other cases, they're customizations that package maintainers are not interested in making. In both scenarios, those repositories have been forked within the U.S. Tax Court's GitHub organization, and the modifications made there. Those repositories are:

- [serverless-s3-local](https://github.com/ustaxcourt/serverless-s3-local)
- [s3rver](https://github.com/ustaxcourt/s3rver)

_If these repositories are deleted, the build will fail._ To verify that these repositories are still required, see each of the `package.json` files in the repo (e.g., `find . -name package.json -exec grep "github:ustaxcourt" {} \; |awk 'BEGIN {FS=": ";}{print$2}' |uniq`). Note that `s3rver` is a dependency of `serverless-s3-local`, and so it will not be found in our `package.json` files.

## Testing / Coverage Tips

- Run all tests with `npm run test`
- The web client, api, and shared code can be tested with `npm run test:client`, `npm run test:api`, and `npm run test:shared`, respectively.
- TIP: When working through a single test, you can run a single test with `jest /path/to/test/file.js` (you may need to `npm -i -g jest`). Additionally, you can use `--watch` and `--coverage` flags to to continually run the specified test on save and provide a coverage report. For example: `jest /path/to/test/file.js --watch --coverage`

Example coverage output:
```
----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|-------------------|
File      |  % Stmts | % Branch |  % Funcs |  % Lines | Uncovered Line #s |
----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|-------------------|
All files |        0 |        0 |        0 |        0 |                   |
----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|-------------------|
```
- Stmts: % of statements executed in the code
- Branch: % of control structures (for example, if statements) executed in the code
- Funcs: % of functions executed in the code
- Uncovered Line #s: lines not covered by tests
