All minor issues should be settled so that the Court can focus on the issue(s) needing a Court decision. If a party has trouble communicating with another party or complying with this Order, the affected party should promptly advise the Court in writing, with a copy to each other party, or request a conference call for the parties and the trial Judge.

p 
  b.text-underline Continuances.
  |  Continuances (i.e., postponement softrial) will be granted only in exceptional circumstances. See Rule 133, Tax Court Rules of Practice and Procedure. (The Court's Rules are available at 
  a(target="_blank" href="www.ustaxcourt.gov") www.ustaxcourt.gov
  | .) Even joint motions for continuance are not granted automatically.

p 
  b.text-underline Sanctions.
  |  The Court may impose appropriate sanctions, including dismissal, for any unexcused failure to comply with this Order. See Rule 131(b). Such failure may also be considered in relation to sanctions against and disciplinary proceedings involving counsel. See Rule 202(a).

p

  p To help the efficient disposition of all cases on the trial calendar:

  p 
    b.text-underline 1. Stipulation.
    |  It is ORDERED that all facts shall be stipulated (agreed upon in writing) to the maximum extent possible. All documents and written evidence shall be marked and stipulated in accordance with Rule 91(b), unless the evidence is to be used only to impeach(discredit) awitness. Either party may preserve objections by noting them in the stipulation. If a complete stipulation of facts is not ready for submission at the start of the trial or when otherwise ordered by the Court, and if the Court determines that this is due to lack of cooperation by either party, the Court may order sanctions against the uncooperative party.

  p 
    b.text-underline 2. Trial Exhibits.
    |  It is ORDERED that any documents or materials which a party expects to use (except solely for impeachment) if the case is tried, but which are not stipulated, shall be identified in writing and exchanged by the parties at least 14 days before the first day of the trial session. The Court may refuse to receive in evidence any document or material that is not so stipulated or exchanged, unless the parties have agreed otherwise or the Court so allows for good cause shown.

    |  It is ORDERED that all parties shall be prepared for trial at anytime during the trial session unless a specific date has been previously set by the Court.
